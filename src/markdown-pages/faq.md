## General questions

**Do I need to know anything beforehand?**

Knowing how to use a computer would be pretty handy...

**Can I do the course remotely?**

No you pleb, show up everyday or don't bother. Pffft. What do you think this is? Coursera? Do you even code bruh. 

## Course questions

**How much does the course cost?**

The course is for the price of....on the house. Haha nah, at the end you'll owe us a very reasonable Â£50,000. 

We do accept payment plans.

**How long is the course?**

It's normally run as a 12 week bootcamp. But becoming a software engineer is a lifelong dream. You won't stop learning until the day you die!

## Placements

**How long will my placement be?**

Hopefully your placement will last a full year. Unless you're shit. Then you'll be out on your ass within the month.

**How much do I get paid?**

Some serious bank yoooooo.
