## General questions

### Do I need to know anything beforehand?

No! The whole point of our programme is to train somebody who's never coded a day in their life. If you have previous experience coding you'll do well, but it's certainly not a requirement.

### Can I do the course remotely?

Unfortunately the course is only offered on-site at our London offices. We do this to ensure the best learning environment for our candidates as you'll be spending a lot of your time asking questions. 

## Course questions

### How much does the course cost?

The course costs £5000. 

We do accept payment plans if you so require. Please let us know ahead of time if you'd like to request a payment plan.

### How long is the course?

It's normally run as a 12 week bootcamp. But becoming a software engineer is a lifelong commitment. Technology changes so quickly that you'll be picking up new skills all the time! 

## Placements

### How long will my placement be?

Your industry placement will last a full year, at which point you can stay on with your current employer or move on to another job. 

### How much do I get paid?

This is largely ependent on your employer but junior developers typically make between £25000 to £30000.
